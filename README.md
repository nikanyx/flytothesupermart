# Fly to the Supermart
## Java Game – The First of Many 
This project was initiated during the fourth week of the Code for All_ Full-Stack Programming bootcamp in October. 
As first-time programmers working under a deadline, it was quite a challenge! Our mission was to create a simple graphics game within one week.
Together, we brainstormed the game’s aesthetic and mechanics, focusing on an obstacle-avoidance theme. 

The game starts with a menu screen where players can select “Start,” and once in-game, they navigate using the keyboard to dodge obstacles. 
We implemented collision detection for obstacles and a high score counter, which saves the score to a text file, allowing players to keep their high score even after closing the game.
Due to time constraints, we couldn’t fully realize our initial vision of randomized obstacle difficulty after specific cycles or add a long-range attack to immobilize certain obstacles. 
However, we were proud of the final result, and the experience was both rewarding and enjoyable.

This project was a major milestone for us, sparking our curiosity as programmers and helping us understand the challenges and rewards of teamwork toward a shared goal.
